# Kickstarter-Analysis-Challenge-1

## Overview of Project
To analyze the Kickstarter data set for Louise to help compare how other campaign outcomes have performed based on their launch dates and funding goals.

### Purpose
To analyze theater kickstarters, comparing their campaign outcome results to the time of year the campaign was launched to see if there is an optimal time of year to launch a kickstarter. Also, to analyze how all campaign outcomes resulted based on the amount of their inital fiancial target goal broken down in to monetary tiers. 

## Analysis and Challenges
In order to deliver a more acurate analysis on ideal starting campaing goals we would have to convert all the currencies in the data set to be the same. There are about 10 different currencies used therefore our results are not displaying comparable values when looking at optimal fiancial target goals.    

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
From the historical data provided it can be determined that May is the ideal month to start a theater funding campaign and the months of June and July have a signifigantly greater sucess rates than the rest of the year as well. It can also be concluded that starting a campaign in December is the least likey start month to have a successful outcome for theatrical campaings.
